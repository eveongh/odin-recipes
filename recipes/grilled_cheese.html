        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>First we will need to prepare the garlic butter and cream cheese spreads!</strong> We can do this by combining and mixing the ingredients 
                for these two spreads in <em>separate</em> containers.</li>
                <li><strong>Cut two thick slices of sourdough bread</strong> and spread the garlic butter spread on the <em>outside</em> of these slices</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble the sandwich</strong> by <em>flipping the bread over</em> and placing a slice of provolone and colby jack cheese on one 
                piece of bread. Finish assembling the sandwich by spreading the cream cheese spread on top of the slice of bread with provolone and colby jack. 
                Place a slice of harvarti cheese and close the sandwich with the second slice of sourdough bread.</li>
                <li><strong>It's time to grill our sandwich.</strong> Melt some butter in the skillet over medium to low heat. Add the sandwich and cook at low heat 
                    until both sides of the sandwich are golden and the cheese has melted.</li>
            </ol>

            Enjoy!
