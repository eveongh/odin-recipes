        This is a simple recipe for baked mac and cheese!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 container of cavatappi noodles or other noodles of your choice</li>
        <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of flour</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 oz cream cheese</li>
        <li>Shredded colby jack</li>
        <li>Shredded extra sharp cheddar</li>
        <li>Shredded mozzerella</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dijon mustard</li>
        <li>Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>Smoked paprika</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <em>Seasonings are to taste</em>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil noodles</strong> by following the directions on the container. Once cooked, rinse off the noodles in cool water to stop the cooking 
        process.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix</strong> shredded cheese and seasonings separately to make sure they are well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the roux</strong> by melting 3 tbsp of unsalted butter in a pot on medium heat. Add half of the seasoning mixture, flour, cream cheese, and heavy cream to 
        that pot and whisk. Once well whisked, add in the rest of the seasoning mixture and 1 tbsp of dijon mustard.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the cheese sauce</strong> by lowering the heat and gradually adding half of the shredded cheese while whisking.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the boiled noodles with the cheesy sauce</strong> and mix so noodles are well covered.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</strong> While the oven is preheating, get a large pan to bake mac and cheese in. In your pan, place half 
        of the mac and cheese in the container, cover it with the leftover shredded cheese. Add another layer of mac and cheese and top it off with the remaining 
        shredded cheese. Season the top layer with smoked paprika. Cover with foil.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong> for 30 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit with the foil on. Then for an additional 10 minutes with the foil off.</li>
        <li>Let cool, then enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
